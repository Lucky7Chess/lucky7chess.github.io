         <h1>Hi. I'm Kenny.</h1>
         <aside>Also known as <b>Kenneth Shaw</b>, I'm a guy who loves creating hardware/software and I aispire to contribute to the edge of technological understanding.
             I've enjoyed building things such as my ThermoFi Wifi Thermometer for Indiegogo, robots at Team 293, Facial recognition at MIT and even awareness about Bitcoin since 2013.
             I'm in my second year of Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech where I help launch Balloons into space but I'm currently at USC's ICT researching Artificial Intelligence tutoring systems.

      <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
